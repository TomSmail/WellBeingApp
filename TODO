1. Fix Emotion Recognition, Idetify issues and create csv file for storing the data for each voice
 - Write Data from files and create csv with y values and x values stored as one
 - Read the Data from the csv
 - Remove Rows with no data
 - split data into training and testing
 - build model 
 - train model using xgboost (import)
 - use model to create predictions and find mean error
2. Check Spotify Function still works as intended
3. Check Instagram Function still works as intended
  - Research how Instagram is blocking my algorithms
  - Find legal way around
4. Stadardise mood so it can be interpreted from the TraingData.csv file ie put all moods on same scale instead of wide variety of different floats and integers. 
  -"INSTAGRAM_l": ia1.readLikes(), "INSTAGRAM_c": ia1.commentReading(), "SPOTIFY_v": sam2.spotifyReadFull(), "VOICE_e": er2.predictValue("audio1.wav")
  - Change likes to - likes and + likes, 
  - Change comments to range of -2, 2 This is already done by this function so it should be fine. 
  - Change spotify valence to -2, 2 scale Can play around with the weighting of this later!
  - Where -2 is very bad, -1 is bad, 0 is neutral, 1 is good, 2 is very good.
5. Write an exception handler for instagram
  - I need to know that instagram will not hold up the entire process
  - I will instead replace the two instagram values with a zero instead of putting NA in their position.
6. Create a way to interpret the data so that a single mood value can be extracted
  - Add up all the values
  - Maybe add a way to change weightings?
7. Make a way to record audio
  - needs to delete past recording and make a new recording
8. Make a kivy app
9. Write algorithm to, based on users current emotion, do certain things
  - eg make happy playlist if the user is sad. 
  - other things can be worked out later
  - selection of if statements - > take output of mood and see if it is greater / less than certain values
  - then respond to this with 
10. Write Proper Comments on all of the different pieces of code
  - audioRecording
  - ER2
  - PsswrdEncoding
  - Instagram
  - Spotify2
  - RecordingData
  - App
11. Fix Instagram code / make it cleaner
  - Each function should be relatively selfcontained
  - for comparing use dataframe, it needs to be updated
  - then just compare the latest posts ie ones that are less than two days old with all time posts
12. Create way to get Spotify Happy Vibes playlist without any happy songs in past 50 songs
13. Get Multitasking working with kivy
  - Need to be able to run multiple threads at once
14. Want to make a way to change settings in a settings file
  - settings file should be a dictionary
  - need to be able to get and set values
  - want 3 paramaters to pass into the function 
  - bool for set/get, (if set is true - > ) value of set, dictionary id
